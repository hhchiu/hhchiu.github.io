I received my B.S. in [Electrical Engineering](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php) from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), ranking 8th among 189 EE graduates. I am currently working with Prof. [Lung-Han Peng](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/bio1.php?id=58) on lasers and conoscopy, and Prof. [Homer H. Chen](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/bio1.php?id=60) on photorealistic rendering for augmented reality.

My research interests include optics, photonics, metasurfaces, computational displays, nanoLEDs, and microLEDs, aiming to miniaturize AR head-mounted displays while simultaneously enhancing resolution and brightness. I like to study cutting-edge technology and cool mathematical theories. When I am free, I usually play table tennis, read manga, or go on small travels.
Here is my [resume](./assets/pdf/Resume_of_Hung-Hsiang_Chiu.pdf).
